Foundation modules for _Tag Mixing_
====

_‘Tag Mixing’_ is a modular gameplay system for designing outdoor chasing games, like tag and hide-and-seek. This repository hosts the building blocks for the project which are used in every outcome, as in the _Tag Mixing_ cards, the _Tag Mixing_ map, and the the future _Tag Mixing_ app ([repository](https://github.com/nclm/tagmixing-app)).
